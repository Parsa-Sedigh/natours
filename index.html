<!-- The <header> is obviously a block in BEM. Because it is a standalone component that is meaningful on it's own.So it's a block and
 so all the elements that are inside it, should also have the header attached to them.For example: .logo-box can only exist in the header,
 so it's an element. Because it's part of a block. but it has no standalone meaning. So we should add the header to the element's class name.
 and also .logo must be .header__logo . Because this logo with this exact size and this exact <img> inside it, it only just exists
 in the header.Right?So we say .header__logo
  .-->
<header class="header">

    <!-- Why we put the <img> inside a <div> ? Because the <img> is an inline element and it's a better practice that we put
    this <img> inside a small container and then position that container to where we want that image and it's container to be.
     alt attr is to describe the image and it is important for SEO, but also in the case that some how the image fails to load,
     then on the website instead of image the value of alt will appear.-->

     all about and it's important that we basically put the TITLE of our web page in <h1> and then put text: is where life happens
     in <h2>. Now in the primary-heading we have text : outdoors , so we could just put outdoors in <h1>, but that's not what we want,
     because we don't want our primary text or title of the website to just say : outdoors, instead we want all of text :
     outdoors is where life happens to be the title of our page in google, so we must somehow divide this text. So we can use <span>
      element to give some parts of the text special style and some other parts another styles... (span is to style some text in a
      different way than the rest of the text.)-->

         this box (<a> element. and this <a> also should stay at the center of .header element. So we can't just center the <h1> and
         <a> individually but we can center them all inside a container.)

        <div class="u-center-text">
            <!-- For centering this <h2> element, we can wrap it into a parent element and then center the text from that wrapper and
            we can define a utility class. So what does the .u-center-text class does, is very simply center the text that is inside of it
            and u in u-center-text stands for utility. But why we didn't call this utility class for example: heading-secondary-parent or
            something like that? Because we want to REUSE this utility class. So utility classes are classes that we can use them again
            in future, so they must have a general name.
            Learn: Utility classes are very SIMPLE classes in css, which only have ONE SIMPLE GOAL.
            In this case this utility class simply just center the text that inside it.
            Now why we used text-align: center on parent of <h2> to center it? Because we know <h2> is a block element BUT in our
            scss, we make it as a inline-block element. So if we set the parent of an inline-block element to have the
            text-align=center; then the inline-block elements that are inside of that parent would be treated as text and therefore
            they would be centered IN THEIR PARENT.

          We want some space between <h2> and the elements that come after it. Like the image composition and some text.
         (The .row that comes after the heading-secondary). So we could simply add some margin-bottom to the <h2>. (Remember:
         We can't add margin-bottom to the .u-center-text utility class. Why? Because it most be a reusable class or a general class
         that has just one goal and it shouldn't add some other stuff like space or anything else.)
         What's wrong with this approach? We must start thinking ahead. We would have other <h2 class="heading-secondary"> further in
         our website. So the space that they have is not always the same. So if we go ahead and add a margin-bottom to this class
         then it would influence other <h2 class="heading-secondary"> that we would have across the page.
         So we must use a utility class. So it would be u-margin-bottom-8 which 8 is 8rem.
         Learn: So the u-margin-bottom-8 utility classes allows us to very easily set some margin across our page in a very simple way, which
          at the same time allows our main components or blocks or elements to stay independent and reusable across the page.So that's the
          reason we created a new utility class here.
          So for other uses of <h2 class="heading-secondary"> we would define another utility class for it's specific margin.
          Because <h2 class="heading-secondary"> would be used in other places, so it is a reusable element and we want it to be
          independent.-->

            <div class="col-1-of-2">

                <!-- It's not good to have a utility class with this name u-margin-bottom-2 which 2 means 2rem. Because it's hard coded
                 right? We hard coded 2rem. What we can do is to use names instead of numbers here. So let's say small instead of 2
                 so in future we can change the small to for example 3rem and all of the places that we used this class will change.
                 But if you used u-margin-bottom-2 , then if you change the margin-bottom of this class to 3, you must change the name
                 of the class to u-margin-bottom-3 and therefore you must change ALL of the places that you used this class to the new one.-->

                <!-- In this image composition in here, when we hover on an image,it comes up and also the other images becomes smaller
                  simontinously and when we hover out, the other ones become bigger and the image that we was hover on it, becomes smaller.
                  So when we hover out, all of the images go to their initial size.

                  Here we have the block which is called composition and then the elements of this block are photo. But we also
                  need a modifier for 3 images that we have in this block. Because they are in three different positions. So we need
                  a modifier for each of those images. So let's define a modifier and for this, we add a second class.
                  Why we added a second class instead of

                  In emmet we can say: .composition> and > in emmet means we are now defining the children of .composition class.
                   So for example when we say: .composition>img.composition__photo , we're saying that in composition class, we need
                   an <img> with class of composition__photo.
                   Learn: For defining a second class in emmet, we concat another dot to the previous class. So when we say:
                    .composition>img.composition__photo.composition__photo--p1 , it means first create a div with composition
                    class and then in it's children, create an <img> element with classes of composition__photo and composition__photo--p1
                    p1 stands for picture1(photo1) and now we want to create this child 3 times. So put parentheses around that child and
                    then *3 So it would be: .composition>(img.composition__photo.composition__photo--p1)*3 and then hit tab.

                    So in our image composition we have 3 images and they are shared the same element class which is
                    composition__photo and because they're a bit different with each other we also gave them three different second class
                    which all of these 3 classes have a little bit difference and that difference is their modifier.
                    Why we didn't just give them one class that is different with each other?
                    Because they share a lot of similarity but they also have a LITTLE difference. So we gave them a first class
                    that is common among them and also a second class which has modifier.

                    Now because this image composition would be a independent component, let's create a file for it AND look at below:
                    IMPORTANT: WHEN YOU CREATE A NEW .scss FILE, DON'T FORGET TO @import it in main.scss file. (If you want to @import
                     a .scss file into another .scss file that file that you want to @import it must be a scss partial file. So it's
                     name must start with underscore.)

                    Remember: We want to place these images in different places inside their container. So this is why we gave them
                    3 different classes, because they must be in 3 DIFFERENT places. So we must select them one by one and that's why
                    we have the second classes which are modifier classes. But also these 3 images have some common styles so we have
                    a same class for each of these 3 (.composition__photo).
                   -->

                    <!-- The -large image files are our high quality images and we will take care of responsive images where we can
                     change these images according to screen size and resolution.

    <!-- We got our icons from linea.io and download the icon pack .Then go to _basic folder in downloaded stuff, then go to
     _ICONFONT folder. Also we could use _PNG 64 folder and use .png images instead of icons. But that's not a good practice.
     Important: Because images do not nicely scale up or scale down when we scale our web page. But if we instead use an icon
      fonts which are vectors (and we know vectors are good for scaling), so no matter how much we would zoom in or zoom out on
      the page, the icons will always remain nice and sharp and crisp.
     We could also use .svg files from _SVG folder and we will do that in next project.But .svg is a bit more advanced than
     using an icon font. So let's use the _ICONFONT folder and inside this folder we need styles.css and fonts folder. Because
     the fonts folder is where the icons actually live. So let's copy fonts folder and styles.css file to css folder in root of project and
     then rename styles.css to icon-font.css so it's name won't similar to our compiled css file.
     Now we must include the new css file in our index.html file. Because we know before using a css file, first we must include
     it in the html file that we want to use that css file.
     So say: link and then hit tab for emmet.
     Important: Always include the third party css files BEFORE your compiled (custom) css file.

     We have different formats for fonts like .eot or .wott because different browsers can read different font formats. So the authors of
     linea icons, included all different formats in styles.css or icon-font.css, so with using all of those formats,
     the icon fonts gonna work for all of the browsers.
     Recap: in css file of linea icon fonts, all of the fonts are included and then based on those fonts, it will give us one calss
     for each icon that we can use. So all we have to do is to include that class and it will give us the icon.

     Learn: For using icons that we just included, we need to add one of the classes to an element and it doesn't matter what element
      it is, and it becomes like a convention to use the <i> element. Remember that <i> doesn't stand for icon, it stands for italic.
      Because in previous versions of HTML, <i> was used to make text italic. But we no longer use it for making text italic, so
      we can use it for icons.

      For seeing the full list of icons you can open up the icons-reference.html file in _ICONFONT folder and remember the icons
      that have like: basic-world class name, must start with icon- . So it would be icon-basic-world.
       -->
    <!-- section.section-features and then hit tab will give us <section class="section-features"></section>
    In section-features section, we need a row with 4 columns.
    Question: Why we created another <div class="features-box"> in col-1-of-4 ?Wouldn't just <div class="col-1-of-4"> enough for
    each box? No, remember that in the left column of section-about , we wrote the content DIRECTLY into the <div class="col-1-of-2">
    and didn't use another <div> inside left column(<div class="col-1-of-2">) and then put our content inside that inner <div>. But
    here we don't want to do this. So we want to put another <div> inside the column div(<div class="col-1-of-4">) which that div is
    <div class="features-box"> .
    WHY?
    1) Because we want to have to have some space between the boxes (bigger gutter) 2) And more importantly because we want a special
    effect to happen when we hover on one of the boxes(columns). So we want the entire <div class="features-box">
    to scale and goes up a little bit when we hover it and it's better approach to create a separate element(<div class="features-box">)
    for that effect, rather than manipulating our col-1-of-4 class to create that effect on our columns. So we create that effect on
    the inner class of <div> not our good old col-1-of-4.
    Important: So we never want to touch the col-1-of-4 or any other class like that.In other words the code for grid should remain
     unchanged (no animation or no additional padding or manipulating padding or ...). So we can create another <div> to implement the
     custom css.

     feature-box is a component. So create it's file and then @import in in main.scss

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-1-of-3">
                <div class="card">
                    <!-- We created another <div> inside <div class="col-1-of-3"> , because we don't want to touch col-1-of-3 class
                     for our custom css. Instead we can create another div inside that column div.

                     We have 3 cards that each have 2 sides, so there's 2 modifiers for distinguishing sides of cards and also we hav
                     a gradient for each card that is different from each other. So we need another modifier class for gradients.
                     So with these 2 modifier classes for each card, we first specify the front or back of a component(with
                     .card__side--front and .card__side--back) and then we have very specific class to specify the gradient of
                     the back of the component with another modifier for just BACK of the card not front of it(.card__side--back-1).-->

                    <div class="card__side card__side--front">
                        <!-- We have 3 elements in FRONT of cards.image, text, list.
                         Learn: In BEM methodology, we don't nest element names. So in the class attr of next <div> we shouldn't name
                          it card__side__picture , this is wrong. Although the previous block__element was card__side , but we shouldn't name
                          it card__side__picture. So we shouldn't nest element names.
                          Or if we look from the <div class="card"> , the elements shouldn't be like: card , card__card__side ,
                          card__card__side__card__picture and ... . But we keep the block. So in our example you can see that card
                          which is the block is duplicating in the class names and that's okay. So two elements (in BEM,
                          elements which have block__element classes) shouldn't be dependent on each other.
                          So in this case, card__picture is a complete new element, means it's dependent from card__side. But modifiers are
                          dependent to elements. So: block__element--modifier is kind of dependant on it's element(block__element) .-->
                        <div class="card__picture card__picture--1">
                            <!-- Learn: Why we left this <div> empty, instead of using an <img> element here?
                                  Because we want to use background blend modes for background-image property in css. So we define this
                                  image in css(background-image) not html(<img>) to apply on it some blend styles.
                                  Because those background blend modes can't be apply on <img> html elements.
                                  So with these reasons, I leaved empty this <div> and didn't use <img> in markup.
                                  Background blend modes are some cool effects that we can apply on background-image css property and
                                  not on <img> html element.
                                  BUT ACTUALLY WE MUST PUT SOMETHING! HERE. So let's just put space here with html special symbol for
                                  space.

                                  Because we have 3 DIFFERENT pictures for our cards, we need a modifier for each class to style
                                  those different picture with those modifier classes.-->
                            &nbsp;

                        <!-- We shouldn't use div for this heading, so <div class="card__heading"> is not good. Because it's not
                         really semantic. Semantic means that we're using the right HTML tag for the right content. So if we have
                         content for heading, we should use the right html tag which is one of the <h1> or <h2> or ... . In this case,
                         it's <h4>-->
                        <h4 class="card__heading">
                            <!--

                             Now we want this heading to be ON TOP OF image. So we must use absolute positioning and with
                             position: absolute; we can use top and left and ... properties which are distances from the nearest
                             container which has position:relative; which in this case that nearest container with position:relative
                             to this element is .card element.

                             Now in order to make the text inside this <h4> to be in 2 lines and with a gradient behind each of them,
                             we need to use box-decoration-break and in order to make this property to work, we have to create
                             a new element inside of this <h4> which is a <span> and the text inside <h4> goes inside this new
                             <span>. For this <span> we also need a modifier class. Because we want three different gradients on these
                             <span>s, but they also have some common styles. So for common styles we have card__heading-card class and
                             for different styles between these <span>s , we have the second class which is a modifier class.

                             Remember: In card__heading-span or card__heading-span--1 , -span is not a modifier! It's part of the
                             element. So in those classes the element is heading-span.-->
                            <span class="card__heading-span card__heading-span--1">The Sea Explorer</span>

                          So remember that flexible images for responsive web design always got width or height in some circumstances
                          specified for them. What circumstances?
                          In other words under what circumstances we must use width for image or height for image?
                          If in dimensions of image, width is bigger than height, we can't give it width of 100% because in that case
                          some parts of images would be cut. So we must give it height of 10% instead of width of 100%.

                          In this case, we gave story__img , a height of 100%. Because it's width(2000px) is bigger than
                          it's height(1333).
